# unified.css
Tried my hand at making a CSS reset sheet

How to use:
1. clone the git repo to your working directory
2. use the HTML markup `<link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' href='unified.css'>` to link to where it is.
3. profit

Progress Bar
- Unified has one css class reserved > unified_progress
- This can be sized with font-size, as it uses em as its units.
- To change progress, put `<span style="width:x%"></span>`, with the x replaced with the vaue you want.

I included a javascript file for you to persecute Internet Explorer users with, as this is not supported on Internet Explorer. It supports Firefox and Chromium browsers.

# Recommended: read the example HTML file included to see how things work.
